Thomas Alva Edison was an American inventor who held a world-record 1,093 patents and created the world's first industrial research laboratory. He was born on February 11, 1847 in Milan, Ohio, the seventh and last child of Samuel and Nancy Edison. He had very little formal schooling and set up a laboratory in his father's basement at age 1014. He moved to Michigan with his family when he was seven and started earning money selling newspapers and candy on trains at 12. He invented groundbreaking technology, including the lightbulb and the phonograph, and was considered the face of technology and progress in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He died on October 18, 1931 in West Orange, New Jersey.
